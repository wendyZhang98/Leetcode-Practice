### Description:
# Given an array a[] of size N which contains elements from 0 to N-1
# you need to find all the elements occurring more than once in the given array




### Example: 
# Example 1:
# Input:
# N = 4
# a[] = {0,3,1,2}
# Output: -1
# Explanation: N=4 and all elements from 0
# to (N-1 = 3) are present in the given
# array. Therefore output is -1.

# Example 2:
# Input:
# N = 5
# a[] = {2,3,1,2,3}
# Output: 2 3 
# Explanation: 2 and 3 occur more than once
# in the given array.




### Solution:
class Solution:
    def duplicates(self, arr, n): 
    	# First check all the values that are 
    	# present in an array then go to that 
    	# values as indexes and increment by 
    	# the size of array 
    	for i in range(0, n): 
    		index = arr[i] % n 
    		arr[index] += n 
    
    	# Now check which value 
    	# exists more 
    	# than once by dividing 
    	# with the size 
    	# of array 
    	flag = False
    	res = []
    	for i in range(0,n): 
    		if arr[i]//n > 1: 
    			res.append(i)
    			flag = True
    	
    	if flag == False:
    	    res.append(-1)
    	return res
	    
print(Solution().duplicates(arr=[1,4,2,4,3], n=5))
